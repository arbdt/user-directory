# 19: User Directory

## Description
This is BCS Homework 19: Create a user directory using React. It is supposed to draw a list of randomly generated users from the (randomuser.me) API, and then use React to render a table of image, name, phone, email details.

Ideally, columns of the table would be able to be sorted ascending or descending.
None of that matters however, as the data from the API call is being received but not being sent to the table cell renderer properly.
